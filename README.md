# EnseaShell
The 1st subject EnseaSH.

Here we have first 7 sections of code.
We named them from Main.1 to Main.7,
The codes that we write are with comments between them.

Here are the requirements for each task:

1. Display a welcome message, followed by a simple prompt.

2. Execution of the entered command and return to the prompt (REPL: read–eval–print loop):

 a) read the command entered by user,

 b) execute this command (simple command for the moment, without argument)),

 c) print the prompt enseash % and waits for a new command.

3. Management of the shell output with the command ”exit” or with <ctrl>+d;

4. Display the return code (or signal) of the previous command in the prompt,

5. Measurement of the command execution time using the call clock_gettime;

6. Execution of a complex command (with arguments);

7. Management of redirections to stdin and stdout with ’<’ and ’>’.
